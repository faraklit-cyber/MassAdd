# MassAdd

An Anki add on for mass-adding cards from a block of text. Primarily intended for use as part
of 'sentence mining' when learning a foreign language.

### Installation
 - Simply copy this folder to your addons21 directory or install using ankiweb

### Usage
 - Open the MassAdd window from the tools menu
 - Choose the card type and deck you would like the new cards to be added as. Please
   note that due to anki requiring the first field of a card be non-blank the first
   field of the selected card type will be used to add the text.
 - Copy and paste the text into the window.
 - Each new line of text will be a seperate card. To make this easier you can
   use the 'Add' button to seperate the text into new lines based on a specific
   character, for example you may want to use a full-stop (.) or a comma(,).
 - Click 'submit' and the cards will be created.

### Update Info
  - Compatible with Anki version 25
  - Each word in a line must be separated by tabs
